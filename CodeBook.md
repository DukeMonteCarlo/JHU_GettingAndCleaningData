## Data ##

The data is tidy and stored in the run_analysis_summary_dataset.txt file which is a text file in the row-column format with a header. The space is used as the separator of two adjacent columns. All data cells contain numeric numbers except those under the *Activity* column.

## Transformation ##

A script in terms of a R function named *run\_analysis* was developed to transform the [source data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip "source data") to the tidy data.   This function takes an input argument as the path to the folder where the source data used to derive the tidy data resides and generates the tidy data which is stored in a file named *run\_analysis\_summary_dataset.txt* under the folder defined by the input argument. 

The function requires three packages including *dplyr*, *plyr* and *LaF* and performed the following tasks on the source data to generate the tidy data.

1. Combines the observations on human subjects, human subject identifiers, activity types and variables in each observation which are stored in various files into a single data frame
2. Selects required columns from the data frame with the associated variable names containing mean and std where std stands for standard deviation.
3. Sorts the rows in the order of subject identifier as well as activity
4. Aggregates the rows in the group by subject as well as activity
5. Generates mean values for each group and each variable
  

## Data Preparation ##

The tidy data set was derived and transformed from the source data by using a script named *run_analysis*.  Here are the steps that were performed on the source data to obtain the tidy dataset.

1. Selected a folder as the data folder
2. Downloaded the source data zip file into the data folder
3. Unzipped the file in the data folder
4. Copied the run_analysis.R script into a selected script folder
5. Ran the command source(<the path to the script folder>/run_analysis.R") on RStudio console
6. Ran the command run_analysis(<the path to the data folder>) on RStudio console
7. Located the run_analysis_summary_data.txt file which contains the tidy data
